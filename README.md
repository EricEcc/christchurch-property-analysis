# Coastal Proximity, Environmental Risks, and Property Valuation: A Comprehensive GLM Analysis in Christchurch

## Overview

This repository contains the project files and supporting materials for the **COMP 693 Industry Project** titled **"Coastal Proximity, Environmental Risks, and Property Valuation: A Comprehensive GLM Analysis in Christchurch"**. The project uses Generalised Linear Models (GLM) to analyze the relationship between property values and various environmental factors in Christchurch, New Zealand, with a specific focus on coastal proximity and flood risks.

## Project Summary

This research project uses a combination of Generalised Linear Models (GLM), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and other statistical techniques to assess the impact of environmental factors, such as coastal proximity and flood risks, on property values in Christchurch. The project evaluates property data using advanced data cleaning and visualization techniques to draw insights into Christchurch's real estate market, with a particular focus on the city's coastal suburbs.

## Repository Contents

1. **Project Weekly Journal**: A weekly log detailing the progress of the project.
2. **Cleaned and Unified Dataset**: The final dataset used for analysis in CSV format, containing property data with relevant variables such as distance to the coast, floor area, and flood zone status.
3. **Structured Excel File**: Contains relevant datasets along with descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviations of key variables.
4. **QGIS Project File**: Includes geocoded property layers, coastline proximity measures, and flood zone data layers. This file can be used to replicate the GIS analysis conducted in the project.
5. **Comprehensive R Script File**: A well-documented R script detailing the entire data analysis process. This script includes data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model testing, assumption checking, and results visualization. The script is structured for reproducibility and includes error handling, as well as outputs for all stages of the analysis.
6. **Final Research Report**: The complete research report that integrates all findings, including model outputs, diagnostics, and visualizations. It includes supporting appendices with code snippets, maps, graphs, and more detailed analyses.
7. **Results and Visualizations**: The results of the GLM analysis, including model coefficients, diagnostic tests (e.g., Cook's Distance), summary statistics, and visualizations such as Residuals vs. Fitted values plots.

## Key Features

- **Generalised Linear Models (GLM)**: Used to assess the relationships between property values and environmental factors such as coastal proximity and flood risk.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Integrated GIS analysis using QGIS to assess the geographical distribution of property values and environmental risks.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Extensive data cleaning and exploration to ensure a high-quality dataset, suitable for regression modeling.
- **Model Diagnostics**: Comprehensive diagnostics and assumption checks to validate the GLM model.
- **Visualizations**: Visual outputs generated using both R and QGIS, including property maps, histograms, and scatter plots.

## How to Use

1. **Run the R Script**: The main R script, found in the "Comprehensive R Script File" folder, can be executed to replicate the data analysis. The script includes instructions for installing necessary libraries and using the provided data.
2. **Open the QGIS Project**: The QGIS project file can be opened with QGIS software to view and manipulate the geospatial data used in the project.
3. **Review the Final Report**: The "Final Research Report" folder contains the final report and supporting appendices. The report integrates all project findings, including the R code snippets and geospatial visualizations.

## Requirements

- **R**: Install R and the necessary libraries listed in the R script.
- **QGIS**: Install QGIS for the geospatial analysis and visualizations.
